## Scale Mode

I created the Scale Mode devices to make it easier to use the MIDI Figter 3D as a melodic input device.

Scale mode takes a range of input notes and maps them to a continuous scale. It differs from the stock
Scale MIDI effect becuase it doesn't repeat (or drop) any notes that are out of scale. This allows any standard button/pad
controller that sends MIDI note messages to be used in a similar manner to the Ableton Push devices.
